# üëã Hey, I'm Flavio!

I'm a full-stack software engineer from Brazil with 19 years of experience, with the last 14 years working remotely. I've been leading front-end teams since 2007.

I have experience working directly with co-founders and designers throughout the feature spec and design process to deliver engaging and performant apps.

## üöÄ OpenTask.app

I've just shipped [OpenTask.app](https://opentask.app), a fully responsive PWA MVP in seven weeks while learning new tech. It's free and [open source](https://github.com/opentask-app/pwa).

I built it on [React](https://react.dev/), the new [Next.js App Router](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrxiNfbr63s&ab_channel=Vercel), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Postgres), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and set up CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

It leverages new features from React and Next.js, including [React Server Components (RSCs)](https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components) and [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions).
