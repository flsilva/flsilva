# üëã Hey, I'm Flavio!

I'm a senior full-stack engineer with 20 years of experience, with the last 11 years building products remotely for American startups. I specialize in <b>React</b>, <b>Next.js</b>, and <b>Node.js</b>, and I have a track record of leading teams, architecting solutions, and collaborating with founders and designers to drive business results.

## üöÄ OpenTask

Recently, I built [OpenTask](https://flsilva.com/opentask-showcase/), an [open-source](https://github.com/opentask-app/pwa) and responsive task management MVP showcasing modern web development practices with [React Server Components](https://flsilva.com/blog/react-server-components-and-a-new-hybrid-web-app-model/) and the new [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).
<br><br>
OpenTask implements [Nexar](<a href="https://nexar.dev/">), a [modular](https://flsilva.com/blog/what-is-software-architecture/#modules-and-modular-architectures) and [layered](https://flsilva.com/blog/what-is-software-architecture/#layers-and-layered-architectures) application architecture I designed to help teams build scalable and maintainable Next.js App Router apps.

I built OpenTask on [React](https://react.dev/), the new [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Postgres), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and set up CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

It leverages new features from React and Next.js, including [React Server Components (RSCs)](https://flsilva.com/blog/react-server-components-and-a-new-hybrid-web-app-model/) and [Server Actions](https://flsilva.com/blog/react-server-components-and-a-new-hybrid-web-app-model/#server-actions).
